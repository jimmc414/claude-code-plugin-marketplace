# Synthesis Prompt

## Context

You have completed {iterations} iterations of research on:

**Original Research Question:**
{question}

**All Accumulated Findings:**
{all_findings}

**Sources Consulted:**
{sources}

## Task

Synthesize the research findings into a comprehensive, well-organized report.

## Synthesis Guidelines

### Organization

1. **Group by Theme, Not Chronology**
   - Organize findings by logical subtopics
   - Don't structure by "iteration 1, iteration 2..."
   - Let the content dictate the structure

2. **Create Clear Sections**
   - Each section addresses a distinct aspect
   - Use descriptive headings
   - Maintain logical flow between sections

### Synthesis (Not Summarization)

1. **Connect Findings**
   - Draw connections between different sources
   - Identify patterns across the research
   - Show how pieces fit together

2. **Reconcile Conflicts**
   - When sources disagree, present both views
   - Note where consensus exists
   - Explain likely reasons for disagreement

3. **Add Analysis**
   - Go beyond listing facts
   - Interpret what the findings mean
   - Draw reasonable conclusions

### Citation Discipline

1. **Inline Citations**
   - Use numbered references: "The market grew 15% [1]"
   - Every factual claim needs a citation
   - Multiple sources for important claims: [1, 3]

2. **Confidence Indicators**
   - "Multiple sources confirm..." (high confidence)
   - "According to [source]..." (single source)
   - "Sources conflict on..." (disputed)

### Tone and Style

1. **Authoritative but Measured**
   - Write with confidence where evidence supports
   - Acknowledge uncertainty where it exists
   - Avoid hedging on well-supported claims

2. **Specific and Concrete**
   - Include data, dates, names where available
   - Prefer specifics over generalities
   - Quantify when possible

3. **Accessible but Not Dumbed Down**
   - Assume intelligent reader
   - Explain jargon when first used
   - Don't over-explain obvious points

## Output Structure

```markdown
# Research Report: [Topic]

**Generated**: [Date]
**Research Depth**: [N] iterations
**Sources Consulted**: [Count]

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraphs capturing:
- The core answer to the research question
- Key findings that stand out
- Most important implications or conclusions]

---

## Key Findings

### [Subtopic 1 - Descriptive Title]

[Synthesized content with citations]

### [Subtopic 2 - Descriptive Title]

[Synthesized content with citations]

[Continue with as many sections as the content warrants]

---

## Analysis

[Higher-level synthesis:
- Patterns observed across findings
- Implications of the research
- Connections between different aspects
- What this means for the original question]

---

## Limitations & Gaps

[Honest assessment of:
- What couldn't be determined
- Where evidence is thin
- Conflicting information not resolved
- Areas warranting further research]

---

## Sources

1. [Full Title] - [URL]
2. [Full Title] - [URL]
[Continue for all sources]
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Every claim has a citation
- [ ] Findings are synthesized, not just listed
- [ ] Conflicting sources are addressed
- [ ] Organization is logical and clear
- [ ] Executive summary captures the essence
- [ ] Limitations are honestly stated
- [ ] All sources are properly listed
- [ ] Report directly addresses the original question
